# MAKE-3*3-ARRAY-AND-FIND-THERE-ADD-MUL-SUB
#EXPLANATION:<BR>
IN THE PROGRAM WE PERFORM ADDITION ,SUBTRACTION & MULTIPLICATION OF TWO ARRAY.<BR>
#LOGIC:<BR>
IN THE PROGRAM WE CONSIDER THE MATRIX VALUE ACCORDING TO PROGRAMMER.<BR>
DURING CONSIDERATION WE USE 2-DIMENSION ARRAY:<BR>
IN TWO DIMENSION ARRAY WE ENTERED TWO GROUP OF VALUE MEANS FIRST GROUP PRINT ROW AND SECOND GROUP PRINT COLUMN.<BR>
AND NEXT PERFORM ALGEBRIC CALCULATION BETWEEN THEM.<BR>
PERFORM CALULATION :<BR>
 IN ANY ALGEBRIC CALCULATION PERFORM ROW TO ROW.
 FOR EG:-WE PERFORM ADDITION 
 FIRST START WITH 1ST MATRIX 1ST ELEMENT ADD WITH 2ND MATRIX 1ST ELEMENT LIKE THAT PERFORM ALL CALCULATION.
